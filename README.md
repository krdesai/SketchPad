# SketchPad
Implementation of a simple sketch drawing program in Java

The program layout consists mainly of a 2D drawing space along with the ability to select basic modes as follows: 
- A mode to draw sketches using scribbled freehand lines 
- A mode to draw straight lines 
- A mode to draw rectangles 
- A mode to draw ellipses 
- A mode to draw special cases of these (squares and circles) 
- A mode to draw polygons (open and closed polygons) 

In addition, the user is able to select a colour for any of the graphical objects that are about to be drawn. 

Furthermore, the user has a selection method so that they can identify an object that has already been drawn and perform the following operations: 
- Move the selected object to a new location 
- Remove the object from the drawing (delete a graphical object) 
- Copy and Paste the selected object to a new location 

The program contains the following additional functions: 
- Undo and Redo
- Save a partially completed drawing
